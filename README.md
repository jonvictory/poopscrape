# Nothing Scraper



## Description
This app pulls the most recent articles from "https://theblogaboutnothing.blog/" and stores them in a mongodb. 
Users can then access the articles and/or comment on them, by using the appropreate buttons listed on the main page.
Users can also check for updates to the original blog by utilizing the button at the top of the page.

### Left to be done
I could not figure out how to get cheerio and ajax to work with infinite streaming.
I spent much too much time attempting to make multiple ajax calls and getting them to append to a single response.
It seems like there are a lot of tutorials for this sort of thing for tools other than Cheerio. Guessing that Cheerio is becoming outdated.

#### Technologies
